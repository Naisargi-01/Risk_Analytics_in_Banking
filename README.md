Risk Analytics in Banking: An EDA Case Study

This repository contains a comprehensive case study applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the domain of risk analytics in banking and financial services. The objective is to develop a deeper understanding of how data can be utilized to minimize the risk of financial losses while lending to customers.

Business Understanding:
The lending industry faces challenges in making informed loan approval decisions, especially when dealing with individuals with limited credit history. This case study focuses on a consumer finance company specializing in loans for urban customers. By leveraging EDA techniques, we aim to analyze data patterns to identify clients who might face difficulty repaying their installments. This knowledge empowers the company to make well-informed decisions, minimize defaults, and optimize risk assessment strategies.

Business Objectives:
The primary goal of this case study is to pinpoint patterns that indicate the likelihood of payment difficulties in loan applicants. By identifying strong indicators of default, the company can take proactive measures such as adjusting loan amounts, and interest rates, or even approving or denying loans. We strive to enable the company to lend to eligible customers confidently while avoiding potential financial losses.

Data Understanding:
The dataset includes three files:

application_data.csv: Contains client information at the time of application and indicates payment difficulties.
previous_application.csv: Provides information on the client's previous loan data, including whether previous applications were approved, canceled, refused, or unused offers.
